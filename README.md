## Developer Test

### Overview

The Developer Test is a simple test we give our prospective web developers to see how they do given a coding task.

The premise is simple, create a simple website that will be able to perform a search using the Search API for movies containing any of the following words: red, green, blue or yellow.

The output should be a web page that displays matching movies with their details (title, year, runtime and image) on a page. Also, extract the first matching word in the movie title from the list of colours and show it somewhere on the movie details (maybe as the background colour).

Things I have done:

- Front-end page can be found in "./main_page/index.html"
- use of a backend framework / CMS (Wordpress)
- use of a frontend framework (Bootstrap)
- use of git (gitlog has been provided in "./logAndReport/gitlog")
- use of a database (use a database managed by Wordpress)

Optional functionality you may like to include

- Caching of search results (use a local map to cache searching results)
- Good use of DOM counts (The movie page will be unmounted when back to home page)
- Mobile Responsiveness (responsive design, for mobile and web)
- Lighthouse performance export (99/100, report has been provied in "./logAndReport/LighthouseReport")

Notes:

- Your HTML and CSS should pass W3 validation (CSS and HTML are all validated)
